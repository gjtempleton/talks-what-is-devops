# DevOps Glasgow Meetup 7

## What Even is "DevOps"? {% fragment %}

Note: One of the biggest buzz words around

---

# About Me

 * Guy Templeton
 * ~~Software Engineer~~ {% fragment %}
 * ~~DevOps Engineer~~ {% fragment %}
 * ~~Systems Engineer~~ {% fragment %}
 * ~~CloudFormation engineer~~ {% fragment %}
 * Some kind of engineer at Skyscanner {% fragment %}

 Note: I build and maintain internal tooling to help others actually make the beautiful functionality which users see and makes us money

---

# Topics

* What do you think DevOps is? {% fragment %}
* What does the community think DevOps is? {% fragment %}
* What's the current landscape? {% fragment %}
* What's the future of DevOps? {% fragment %}

Note:

Note, this will be a whirlwind tour and this all comes from my biases, take that as you will and a large pinch of salt

---

#What do you think DevOps is?

Note: Obligatory awkward audience participation time. Who's heard of DevOps? Who thinks they're currently using DevOps, either at work, or in personal projects? Who thinks they can define what DevOps means to them?

---

# What does the community think DevOps means?

* Tooling? {% fragment %}
* Specific engineer skills? {% fragment %}
* Culture? {% fragment %}


Note:

It's a term that's been around since at least 2009, so has the community come to a consensus on what it even means? Unsurprisingly, no.

--

## Tooling?

--

## A way to increase your salary?

<image src="/images/Stack_Overflow_Developer_Survey_2017.png"/>

--

## Specific Engineer Skills?

* Do you need DevOps in your job title?
* Does a "DevOps Team" mean your company is "doing DevOps"?
* Someone who knows what CI and CD mean?

Note: These things, unsurpirisngly, don't mean your company is "doing DevOps"

--

## A way to prevent this?

--

## Set of practices?

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment
* Infrastructure as code

Note: Puppet, Ansible, Chef, Saltstack, Terraform, CF

--

## How about...

* Faster delivery of software {% fragment %}
* More reliable delivery of software {% fragment %}
* Shortened feedback loop {% fragment %}
* Continual experimentation {% fragment %}

Note: Sound familiar to anyone, the lean startup by Eric Ries?

--

## Is culture critical?

* Yep

Note: Yep, culture's just about the one thing everyone agrees on. DevOps requires strong communication, no more Dev and Ops silos

## Skyscanner Perspective

* **You build it, you run it** {% fragment %}
* Fail Forward {% fragment %}
* 24/7 Support {% fragment %}
* You decide on your monitoring and alerting {% fragment %}
* Self organising, autonomous teams {% fragment %}

Note: One squad doing monitoring doesn't scale for us in a world of DC + Cloud

---

# What's the current landscape?

--

### Majority of Organisations Surveyed are using it

Gartner survey in 2015 found 61% of organisations surveyed claimed they were:

> already using DevOps, had pilots in place, or that they had plans to implement DevOps during the next 24 months.

_Source: http://www.gartner.com/document/2987231 _

Note: Almost certain this figure has only increased in the time since, although are they using it, or just claiming to Gartner that they're using it?

--

## Performance Metrics for "High Performers"

* 96x faster MTTR {% fragment %}
* 5x lower Change failure rate {% fragment %}
* 46x more frequent deployments {% fragment %}

_Source: Puppet 2017 State of DevOps report_

Note: Take these metrics with a big pinch of salt, "high performers" are measured via throughput of code and stability of code

--

## Performance Metrics for "High Performers"

### Less manual:

* Config management
* Testing
* Deployments
* Change approval

---

# What does the future look like?

--

--

## Proliferation of tooling to ease adoption

* Containers - Docker, rkt {% fragment %}
* Container Orchestration - Kubernetes, ECS {% fragment %}
* Continuous Integration tools improving - Jenkins, Drone {% fragment %}
* Continuous deployment tooling {% fragment %}
* Blue/Green deployments - Spinnaker {% fragment %}

--

## Proliferation of other practices

* HumanOps {% fragment %}
* DevSecOps {% fragment %}

Note: Devsecops: Everyone's responsible for security, just as Devops emphasises everyone being responsible for ops, Human Ops focuses on the human aspects of running infrasturcture
